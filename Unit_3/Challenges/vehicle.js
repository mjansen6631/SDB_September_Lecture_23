/*
Part 1 
    - Create a class that is meant to create a vehicle.
        - Should have these keys:
            - make, model, no_wheels, color
        - Should have two methods
            - The first method will print (console log):
                "The [color] [make] [model] turns on its engine"
            - The second method will print (console log):
                "The [color] [make] [model] turns off its engine"
    - Create a vehicle using the class and "turn on" and "turn off" the vehicle.
    - Print (console log) the complete object created.
*/


class Vehicle {
    constructor (make , model,no_wheels,color){
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.no_wheels = no_wheels;
        this.color = color;
    }

    engineOn() {
        console.log(`The ${this.color} ${this.make} ${this.model} turns on its engine.`);
    }
    engineOff() {
        console.log(`The ${this.color} ${this.make} ${this.model} turns off its engine.`);
    }
};

// let newCar = new Vehicle("Honda","Civic", 4 , "gray" );
// newCar.engineOn();
// newCar.engineOff();
// console.log(newCar);




/*  
    - Using the Vehicle Class
        - Update the Vehicle Class to include a new property called "engine_on". Have it hold no value.
        - Update both methods to change the value of "engine_on" to either "true" if the vehicle is on or "false" if the vehicle is off.
    - Create a Sedan class that extends form the Vehicle class
        - The constructor will use all the values from the Vehicle class and add a "tank".
            - The "tank" will hold a numeric value (10-14 typically).
        - The Sedan class will need to have a factory method called "parkedCar". 
            - This will set the "engine_on" value to "false"
            - Create a new Sedan passing in the expected arguments.
                (make,model,no_wheels,color,tank)
        - This class will have a method called "drive" that accepts a parameter called "gallons".
            - This will need to evaluate:
                - Is the sedan on?
                    - If off, console.log "The [color] [model] needs to be turned on."
                    - If on,
                        - Does it have enough gas?
                            - If it does: console.log "You drive around and use up [gallons] gallons of gas.".
                                - adjust the number of gallons current in the tank.
                            - If it does not: console.log "There isn't enough gas in the [make] to drive that many miles."
