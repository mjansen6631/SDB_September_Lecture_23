// *Variables

/* Variable are named containers for storing data values.

We name the variables so that we can refer to them and the values they hold at a later time.  Consider that we are naming these variables to help us be directed to a value type.

    We can create a variable through three different keywords:
    1. var
    2. let
    3. const
    4. (none)
*/

let a= 2;
// (1)  (2)  (3) (4)  
    let  b   =   1;

/* 
1. Use JS keyword to denote the creation of a variable
2. The name of the variable, what the developer refers to/calls on to get the stored value. Variable names should be concise and pertain to the data.
    - Should be camelCase, lower case first letter & and uppercase next each starting letter
3. Assignment operator: equal sign, =
4. The initial variable value, it's starting date value.
*/

// *Variable Declaration Vs Initialization*

// Declaration: declaring the variable but not assigning it.
let x;
console.log("Declaration of x:  ", x);

let apple;

// Initialization: variable is given/set a value.
let y=4;

let life=42;

// Reassign a variable value: reassign declared or initialized variables (not const keyword variables)
x = 20;
console.log("Initialization 1:", x)

x = 100;
console.log("Initialization 2:", x)

apple = 12;

// *Assigning to Other Variables / create variables from variables!

let firstName = "Matt"; //string datatype
let lastName = "Jansen";

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName + " "

/* 
    * CONSOLE

    - A place to see text output/code results. 
    - There is a console object attached to the browser (web)
    - We have a console in VSC to view results/what is logged. 
    .log(), this is the log method of the console, log will print whatever it is passed.

console.log(fullName); //  Matt Jansen

console.log(2+2) // 4
