    ? While Loops

    - While loop, loops through a block of code WHILE a specific condition is true.

    Structure: 
    while (condition) {
        ...code to run/execute
    }

    - The main purpose for while loops are when the iteration is uncertain.
        - aka we don't know how much content is in the data we are referencing/looping through

/* 
    ? Do While Loops
    - Also loop through a block of code while a specified value is TRUE but ...
    ! loop will run the code block ONCE, BEFORE checking if the condition is true and will keep running as long as the condition stays true.


    Structure: 
    do {
        code ot run/execute
    } while (condition)

    - Works just like while loops with the exception that it will run code block at least once.
