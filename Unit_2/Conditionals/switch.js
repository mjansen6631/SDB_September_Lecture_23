/* 
    Switch Conditional Statement
    - A switch statement executes/runs a block of code depending on different cases.
    -The switch is used together with a break or a default keyword or both.
        - These are both optional.
        - Break: keyword that breaks out of the switch block. If a break is omitted/not added the next code block in the switch will run (run as well)
        - Default: keyword that specifies code to run if no case matches (think what or else did in if statements).
