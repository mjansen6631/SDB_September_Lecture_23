/* 
    CONDITIONALS
    - It's a way for us (as developers) to ask a question and provide a response depending on the condition of what we're asking.
    - Devs == Inventors: we design and ask the question but also determine the answer.
    - Conditionals focus on a thing being true or false.
    - Evaluates an expression and responds if it is true.
        - Falsy
            - false
            - 0
            - empty strings
            - null
            - undefined
            - NaN (not a number)
